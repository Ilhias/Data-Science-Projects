# Overview

This project evaluates predictive modelling approaches for breast cancer tumour classification using structured health data. The focus is on model evaluation, risk trade-offs, and interpretability, rather than maximising accuracy alone, reflecting considerations commonly required in health and government analytics settings.

Data

Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (scikit-learn)

569 observations, 30 numeric features

Binary outcome: malignant vs benign

Note: This dataset is clean and does not fully reflect the complexity of real-world clinical data.

Approach

Stratified train/validation/test split

Leakage-safe feature scaling using StandardScaler

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with hyperparameter tuning

Performance evaluated using confusion matrices and classification metrics

Key findings

The ANN achieved strong overall accuracy on the test set (~95%)

Recall for malignant cases was prioritised due to higher clinical risk of false negatives

Perfect validation accuracy highlighted the limitations of small validation samples

Interpretation & limitations

While ANNs can achieve high performance, their lack of transparency limits suitability in many clinical and policy contexts

Simpler, interpretable models may be preferred where explainability and governance requirements outweigh marginal performance gains

Results should not be interpreted as clinically deployable without further validation
